h1. rah_tabtor

p. Makes it possible to move backend's navigation links and tabs around. With the "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com plugin, rah_tabtor, you can copy backend's navigation links from one tab to another. Let's say that a plugin generates it's interface under _Extensions_ tab, but you would want it to appear under _Content_. With rah_tabtor that is possible.

h3(#intro-and-description). Intro and description

p. Rah_tabtor let's you to copy backend's navigation links from tab to tab. The plugin doesn't let you hide or remove tabs, but rah_tabtor's solely purpose is cooking copy pasta. If you want to change permissions and hide tabs based on privilege levels, I suggest checking out redbot's "bot_privs":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=28148. The two play well together.
